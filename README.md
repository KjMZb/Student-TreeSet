# Java-Class
These Java classes were created to fulfill an assingment in Advanced Object Oriented Programming at Rochester Institute of Technology.
The assingment called for an implementation of a TreeSet. We were instructed to implement the add, contains, size, isEmpty, and Iterator methods.
In addition, we were to implement an Iterator to be returned by the Iterator method. 
In the end, this implemenatation was 500 miliseconds slower than Java's version of TreeSet.

Future work for this project will be implementing the remove method by backing the TreeSet with a hash map.
